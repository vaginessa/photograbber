# NOTE: This page is now out of date but I believe the concept is still the same. #

# Introduction #

This page addresses two questions:
  1. Why can't I download pictures of a friend even though I can see them online?
  1. How can I prevent people from downloading pictures of me with PhotoGrabber?

# Overview #

The combination of profile privacy settings and application privacy settings will determine whether or not friends with PhotoGrabber have access to your images.

# Relevant Facebook Settings #

## Profile Settings ##
