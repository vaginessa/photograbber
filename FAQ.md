Privacy settings.  A facebook application with a user's credentials has different permissions than the same user accessing facebook from a browser.  The people who have uploaded and tagged pictures of you are probably blocking applications from accessing their information.  Get them to relax their privacy settings or, better yet, get them to use PhotoGrabber too!

# I get a dialog that says "An unidentified program wants to access your computer", what does that mean? #

pg.exe will actually extract a Python executable and the PhotoGrabber scripts to a temporary directory and clean up that directory when the script has finished.  This is just your computer making sure that you give pg.exe permission to access your harddrive.

The pg.exe.log file is probably in a hidden folder like "AppData".  To view and navigate hidden folders follow these steps:

In the file explorer click the "Organize" tab in the upper left. >> Navigate to "Folder and search options" >> Click the "View" tab >> check "Show hidden files, folders, and drives"
